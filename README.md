I scratched my own itch and built something with AutoHotkey that's been a game-changer in the way I organize my searching:
Press 𝗖𝘁𝗿𝗹+𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁+𝗦, type once, and 𝗕𝗢𝗢𝗠! 💥

1. ChatGPT spins up its findings
2. Google scours the web
3. Relevant local files instantly surface

𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵? All three windows pop up side-by-side for the ultimate power-search experience. No more tab-dancing or window-hunting – just a streamlined productivity experience.
